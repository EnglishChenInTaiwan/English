表示對某事物的欲求或計劃，謂之祈願的假設語態(optative subjunctive)。表示只是對某事物的想像、預測，並非事實的陳述，謂之潛在可能的假設語態 (potential subjunctive)
 
【觀念確認】現在形態用於假設，動詞現在式也可用原型V，代表發生此假設的可能性，過去式形態用於假設，be動詞只能用were，代表的是與假設事實的相反性。
註 所謂現在式形態和過去式形態，包括助動詞在內。
 
(1) 潛在可能的假設語態 (potential subjunctive)
(A) 用現在式形態，具有猜測某事發生的可能性，或做為未來某事的條件的意味。
 
這不會是真的吧?
It cannot / may not be true.
 
他說他會盡可能的常來
He says he comes / will come as often as he can.
 
這畜生必定曾來過此
The animal must have been here.
 
無論誰這麼說必定是個騙子
Whoever may say so must be a liar.

The doctor said, “I am afraid that he may not recover.”

我希望他來
I hope (that) he comes / come / may (can/will) come.
 
     真希望明天下雨，那我就不用去了

          I would / had rather (that) I were you.
 
我希望那不曾發生過 (事實已經發生了)
I wish that hadn’t happened.
 
Wish 和 Hope
【觀念確認】當Wish和Hope作為“希望”的意思時，因Wish所“希望”者通常為不確定發生之事物，所以其後多半使用過去式形態(were , might , should…等)，以表示其“只是期待某事發生”的客觀意味；而Hope後多半使用現在式形態(will , shall , can , may…等)，以表示其“有可能發生”的主觀意味。

(C) 直述型態的假設句，用原形動詞，具有強烈意志的意味。
 
(i)suggest, propose, advise, insist, assume, advocate…. 等具有讓步意味的動詞之後的子句，子句中的should可省略

            The teachers proposed that the student (should) be punished.

      我堅持：他(應)該為他自己的錯而道歉
            I insisted that he(should) apologize for his own fault.
 
           (ii)虛主詞句型(It is + 形容詞 + that + 子句) 中…. 若形容詞之後的子句具有讓步意味，則子句中的should可省略
 
      強姦犯去勢是有必要的
            It is necessary that the criminal committing rape (should) be emasculated.

            It is proper that an impenitent criminal (should) receive heavy sentence.
 
註 主觀的意念碰上客觀的事實則須用讓步語氣(應有should)，
省略了should主要是用來加強主觀意念的語氣。
 
 
(2) 祈願的假設語態 (optative subjunctive)
(A) 祈願的假設語態，是永遠的未來狀態，因此動詞僅用現在形態或原型V，原型V表達是最強烈的祈願，甚而形成祈使句(Imperitive Mood)。
 
【觀念確認】祈願的假設語態，通常為(I wish that …may…)的省略；滿懷希望的wish (Sanguine subjunctive of wish)，意為主觀的“但願…”，而不是客觀的“希望”。
但願上帝保佑你
I wish that God (may) bless you. = May God bless you. = God bless you.
 
通通不要動
I wish that everybody don’t move. = Everyboby don’t move.
 
讓他進來吧
I wish that you (may) let him come in. = May you let him come in. = Let him come in.
 
單就…而言，已經就夠了
I wish that I may suffice it to say that …= May I suffice it to say that …= Suffice it to say that ……
 
 
(我想)我們所必須做的事就是用功
(I think that) all that we have to do is (that) we should study harder.
= All that we have to do is (to) study harder.
= All that we have to do is study harder.
 
 
但願他已經搞定了，那我們(現在)就能離開了(不知道他搞定沒)
I wish (that) he has / may have / have done it, then we can go now. (對未知的期待)
 
真希望他有搞定，那我們早就已經離開了(已知因為他沒搞定)
I wish (that) he had / might have done it, then we would have left. (與過去事實相反)
 
我想當有錢人
I wish (that) I were a rich man. (與現在事實相反)
 
註 最後三句請注意比較其語氣上，及文法上的差異；If + 五大句型，請參閱 “從屬連接詞 If 假設語氣”。
 
無論來去，悉聽尊便
Whether you come or go, it’s up to you.
Whether you may come or go, it’s up to you.
Come or go, it’s up to you.
